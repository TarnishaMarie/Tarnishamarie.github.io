		​After graduating from highschool in Richmond Hill, Georgia I moved to Atlanta to pursue my Bachelor's of Science in Industrial Design from the Georgia Institute Of Technology. I always loved art classes and being creative, but this is where i got a glimpse of what it truly means to be a designer. My main goal was to be a designer with more emphasis on the human involved and develop strong rationales behind my design decisions. I then moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to pursue my Masters in Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University.

		In my free time, I love to take on DIY projects, Google random things, cook, travel, and call my mom for a good laugh. I love versatility and finding things that pique my curiosity. Overall, I consider myself an easy going person who works hard. I love being surrounded by individuals with big personalities and even bigger ideas.

		Here are some fun facts : I've never went to a school for more than three years in a row, I've flown on a trapeze, I've only had two bruises my whole life, I'm  allergic to safflower oil.
